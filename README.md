Hello, I am Diego Iglesias, I am 28 years old and I am Full Stack MERN developer Junior eager to progress in this profession.

Since I was a child, I had a very strong logical thinking that led me to learn hard subjects such as physics, mathematics or chemistry very quickly. I have the ability to learn new technologies quickly, particularly the logical part.

I started studying because I am a huge fan of mathematics, technology and video games. I am a very patient and methodical person, which allows me to enjoy hobbies such as papercraft.

I currently have knowledge of Javascript, React, React Native, NextJs, Redux/Context, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, Jira, Git and Github.
